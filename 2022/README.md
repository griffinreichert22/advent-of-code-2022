## Best things I learned & improved on:
- zip()
- the power of tuples
- caching
- throwing asserts in your code
- using built in methods and libraries:
    - heapq
    - deque
- global variables
- use of classes
- using stack based algs over recursive ones
- pattern recognition and subproblem optimisation to scale to large solutions
- decorators
- defining custom data structures
